 Accurate and quantitative analysis of cell wall deformation by computer vision

This repository is aim to submit current work to international journal (potential journal: Journal of The Royal Society Interface, Plant methods, Scientific reports, Holzforschung, Wood science and technology....).

### Generation introduction of this repository:

As a natural cellular material, wood has complex structure with
different cell types (anatomical features) acting together to serve the needs
of living tree. Those features have large variation with different wood
species that highly influence the mechanical properties of wood [2]. To unveil
the relationship between anatomical features and mechanical behavior of wood, the
quantitative and accurate analysis of local deformation of anatomical features during
the mechanical test is an important subject. However, due to its technical
difficulty, only a few studies around this topic have been conducted.

On the other hand, with the development of computer vision in the
field of artificial intelligence, the semantic segmentation has been proposed
as a promising approach to label each pixel of an image with a corresponding
class of what is represented. If such approach can be applied into the field of
wood science, it provides a possibility to simultaneously analyze almost all
local changes in anatomical features and their interaction during the mechanical
test.

Therefore, as a preliminary try in this study, the semantic
segmentation model has been built to conduct partitioning of anatomical
features, and their local deformation during the micro three-point bending test
were precisely analyzed.
